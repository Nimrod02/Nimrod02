# Hi there 👋

🚀 **Pentester in Training | Ethical Hacker | Back-end Developer**

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast, currently honing my skills in penetration testing, assembly language, and secure systems design. Passionate about protecting critical infrastructure, I am actively looking for new opportunities where I can contribute to challenging environments while continuing my learning journey.

### 🔍 **About Me**

- **Cybersecurity Specialist in Training:** Focused on penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and red team operations, using tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, and OWASP ZAP.
- **Rootkit & Low-Level Pentesting:** Currently developing a stealthy x86 rootkit to enhance my penetration testing capabilities. I’m learning assembly language to perform deeper, more advanced attacks at the hardware and kernel level, such as privilege escalation, memory manipulation, and bypassing traditional security measures.
- **Offensive AI in Pentesting**: I’m exploring how AI can be applied offensively in cybersecurity. This includes using AI to enhance the sophistication of attacks, such as automating phishing campaigns, bypassing endpoint detection systems (EDR), and generating evasive payloads in real-time to avoid detection by traditional security measures.
- **Problem Solver:** I enjoy tackling complex security problems and building secure systems that are resilient against both known and unknown threats.
- **Collaborator & Mentor:** As a student teacher at Holberton School, I’ve trained over 35 students in algorithms and data structures, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

### 🌱 **What I'm Currently Learning**

- **Low-Level Pentesting & Rootkits:** I’m diving deep into assembly language and kernel exploitation techniques, focusing on areas like memory management, privilege escalation, and bypassing security measures.
- **Offensive AI & Pentesting**: I’m diving deep into offensive applications of AI, specifically using machine learning to generate real-time evasive payloads, simulate adversarial attacks that can bypass EDR/MDR solutions, and automate the discovery of exploitable vulnerabilities. This includes training models to adapt attack vectors in response to the target’s defenses.
